During the COVID-19 state of alert period, the Spanish Government has passed a number of Royal Decree-Laws implementing measures in different areas.

The main purpose of this project is:

- the analysis of the content of the legal texts passed, generating a COVID-19 shaped word cloud;
- the analysis of the frequency of the words included in the legal texts;
- having fun with Python and Data Science.
